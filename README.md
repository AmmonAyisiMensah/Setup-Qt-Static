# Qt Static Build Script

This repository provides a Bash script to **statically build Qt 6.5.4** from source on Linux, but an other version may also be used.  
The script automates the installation of dependencies, cloning the Qt source code, configuring, building, and installing both **Release** and **Debug** versions.

## Features
- **Static Build** – No external Qt dependencies required when building and deploying applications
- **Configures & Builds Both Release and Debug Versions**  
- **Uses Ninja for Faster Compilation**  

## Prerequisites
Ensure your system has the required development tools:  
- **Ubuntu/Debian-based systems**: The script installs dependencies automatically.  
- **Other distributions**: You may need to adjust the package installation commands in the section `Install Qt Requirements`.
